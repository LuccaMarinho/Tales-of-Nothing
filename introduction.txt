
This is Tales of Nothing!

A very simple RPG Game, based on D&D.
You can choose to Fight or Run, Left or Right and this can lead you into four different finals!!

Doesn't it sound AMAZING!?

It doesn't have a Graphic Interface, it's all playable on Terminal. 
It has a game map, but be careful, it cotains spoliers!!

The game was developed in C++ by me and some friends due to an university project.
I did all the base stuff as Player, Enemies, the dice system and co-created the Battle System.

HAVE FUN AND FEEL FREE TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES!!
